To present your demo two. Your presentation only demonstrate how your project product performs all required functionality. Each group shall use less than 20 minute to present.
To present your project product, you have two options:

Make a presentation video and publish it on YouTube. Publish link on Piazza. Other students can watch and ask questions through comments. The presenting group then answer the questions through comments. The benefit for this option is that each member of the group can present his/her portion separately on his/her convenient time. The disadvantage is that the presentation is not live. The group also need to edit the video to put all presentations together.
The instructor encourages each group to use free tool ZOOM to do live presentation. ZOOM is also can be find in Blackboard Tools link. The advantage for this option is that audience can ask questions during the presentation. The presentation can be recorded for late view. It is also a practice for real world presentation (interactive). The disadvantage is that whole group needs to find a common free time period to join the ZOOM together. Also, you will not be able to "edit" your presentation. If you choose this option, please set presentation time at least one week earlier so that audience can arrange their time to join. Of course, if some audience cannot join live, the ZOOM can record the presentation for late view.
